jen's pipeline was mostly straightforward except:

*cuffcompare requires the 'genome.fa' file from the WholeGenomeFasta folder of the CanFam 3.1 assembly, not the genome.fa that is in the Bowtie2Index folder

*cuffcompare had multiple warnings of 'Warning: couldn't find fasta record 


input for cuffdiff (from /local/workdir/mp793):

cuffdiff -p 8 -o cufflinks_out/cuffcmp.combined.gtf cuffquant_out/abundances_1_old.cxb cuffquant_out/abundances_2_old.cxb...

--> Got warning = 'Warning: No conditions are replicated, switching to 'blind' dispersion model'
	-probably just means that no .cxb files were separated by a ',' and thus technically none of the 		.cxb files were replicates --> spaces separating .cxb files indicates that these were separate 		experiments, i.e. old1, old2, young3


Differential expression analysis using cuffdiff had the following output mid-processing:

Map Properties:
	Normalized Map Mass: 11469478.16
	Raw Map Mass: 9790419.00
	Fragment Length Distribution: Truncated Gaussian (default)
		Default Mean: 200
		Default Std Dev: 80

Same output was repeated x4 (once for each dog RNA sample), but differed in the Raw Map Mass:
(based on order of input)
1_old. 9790419.00
2_old. 12255232.00
3_young. 10759502.00
4_young. 13534691.00

**This is incorrect --> 2 young samples and 2 old samples should have been put together as 'replicates'
--> added ',' between 1_old.cxb and 2_old.cxb files and young files

Same map properties as in the previous trial (confirms that each .cxb file was correctly taken in by the program)
Importantly, at the end of the output the cufflinks program confirmed that it 'Performed 0 splicing tests' which is indeed what we wanted - no novel splice junction discovery

Output = 
gene_exp.diff --> can be opened by excel, with q1 = old, q2 = young
	-Sirt6 did have a significant change between young and old :( 


-Ran Bamtools on the accepted_hits.bam files output from tophat for each of the 4 dog samples, input:

bamtools index -in <path to /accepted_hits.bam>

(rest of the documentation can be found at Tutorial_Toolkit_BamTools-1.0.pdf on the Desktop)

--> This was a necessary step for visualizing the .bam files in IGV (integrative genome viewer) because that program requires the .bam files to be indexed for some reason
